        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming OOP?\n",
        " - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which contain data and methods. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        " - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes variables and methods functions that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        " - An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values instead of variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
        " - Abstraction hides complexity and shows only essential details (focuses on what).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Encapsulation hides internal state and requires all interaction through methods (focuses on how).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, __add__ are special methods with names enclosed in double underscores. They allow customization of built-in operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain inheritance in OOP:\n",
        " - Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and behavior from another class (parent), enabling code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        " - Polymorphism allows the same interface to behave differently based on the object. For example, different classes can implement the same method in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        " - By making attributes private using underscores (_ or __) and accessing/modifying them using getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        " - The __init__() method is the constructor in Python. It's automatically called when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        " - Class methods use @classmethod and access the class itself via cls.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Static methods use @staticmethod and do not access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        " - Python doesn’t support traditional method overloading. You can simulate it using default arguments or *args and **args.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " - It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " - @property allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, typically used to implement getter/setter behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        " - It enhances flexibility and maintainability, allowing different object types to be used interchangeably via a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class contains one or more abstract methods (declared but not implemented). Use abc.ABC module to define them.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Advantages of OOP:\n",
        " - Code reusability\n",
        "\n",
        " - Data hiding\n",
        "\n",
        " - Improved maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "Better problem modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Difference between class variable and instance variable:\n",
        " - Class variables are shared across all instances.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - A class can inherit from multiple parent classes, gaining access to all their properties and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Purpose of __str__ and __repr__:\n",
        " - __str__ is for human-readable string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        " - __repr__ is for unambiguous representation used during debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Significance of super() function:\n",
        " - Used to call methods of the parent class, especially within overridden methods in a subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Significance of __del__ method:\n",
        " - Called when an object is about to be destroyed. Acts as a destructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod:\n",
        " - @staticmethod: No self or cls; acts like a regular function.\n",
        "\n",
        " - @classmethod: Takes cls as first parameter, can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work with inheritance in Python?\n",
        " - Through method overriding and dynamic binding—calling a method on a superclass reference invokes the subclass version if overridden.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " - Calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by returning self from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Purpose of __call__ method in Python:\n",
        " - It allows an instance to be called as a function.\n",
        "\n"
